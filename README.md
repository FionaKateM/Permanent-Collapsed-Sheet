**Permanent Collapsed Sheet** <br />
Boilerplate code for creating a sheet that sits as a small bar at the bottom of the page and expands into a fully functional sheet on a tap. <br /> 
Designed for use within my Recipe app [dindun](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/recipe-planner-dindun/id6461532902) <br />
Ideal for presenting basic information on screen at all times, but within easy reach for more details when needed. <br />
<br />
Fully animated and easy to adjust to suit your project.
